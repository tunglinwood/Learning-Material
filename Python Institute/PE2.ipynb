Responding to this demand, a number of fuzzy string comparison algorithms has been created and implemented. These algorithms are able to find strings which aren't equal in the Python sense, but are **similar**.\n",

If this problem interests you, you can find out more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance.
