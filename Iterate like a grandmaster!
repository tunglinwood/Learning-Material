The focus generally should be two things:\n\n1. Creating an effective validation set\n1. Iterating rapidly to find changes which improve results on the validation set.\n\nIf you can do these two things, then you can try out lots of experiments and find what works, and what doesn't. Without these two things, it will be nearly impossible to do well in a Kaggle competition (and, indeed, to create highly accurate models in real life!)\n\nI will show a couple of different ways to create an appropriate validation set, and will explain how to expand them into an appropriate cross-validation system. I'll use just plain HuggingFace Transformers for everything, and will keep the code concise and simple. The more code you have, the more you have to maintain, and the more chances there are to make mistakes.
